Code from meeting with Megan in 2017 ... 
But with some extra info


Some files here are VERY similar to a couple other files that Lizzie has:

Basically identical (except for half a sentence of notes):
	example-git/multilevel_megan/threelevel_plotsinsites.stan
	stan/usefulcode/Oahu2017/threelevel_plotsinsites.stan

Ditto (but with a few more differences):
	stanexample_plotsinsites.R 
	generatedata_threelevel_plotsinsites.R 

Want another example of nested model?
